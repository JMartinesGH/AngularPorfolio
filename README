AngularPorfolio
===============

Simple portfolio page using Angular.js

I'm just looking to give my portfolio a more app-like feel.

My data content will be stored in work.json

I plan to incorporate multiple views and simple, human readable routing

TODO:
responsive CSS
switch to ng-view
create partials(for ng-view)
